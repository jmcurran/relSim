# relSim 0.3.5

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
* Changed version number format.
* Fixed issue with package documentation.

# relSimon 1.0.0

* Decided to make the version 1.0.0 since the code has been stable for some time
* Fixed profileIBS in the C++ code to deal with unordered alleles
* Fixed lrPC and lrSib - neither were using the f and n arguments correctly
